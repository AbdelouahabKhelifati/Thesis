McObject EVALUATION LICENSE AGREEMENT

READ CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE MEDIA 

If you install the software media, you agree to the terms of this McObject 
Evaluation License Agreement.

McObject LLC will not grant you a license to evaluate the software in the media 
package(s) unless you agree to all of the terms of this Agreement.  If you do 
not accept the terms of this Agreement, promptly destroy the software media 
package(s).  McObject does not accept contrary terms in Purchase or Sales 
Orders.

1.	PARTIES TO THE LICENSE.  This is a legal agreement between you (the 
"Development Entity" as defined below) and McObject LLC, a Washington Limited 
Liability Company ("McObject").

2.	SUBJECT MATTER OF THE LICENSE.  This Agreement is a novation of all 
prior agreements and representations between McObject and you regarding all 
McObject copyrighted software in your possession for evaluation, including the 
contents of the media package(s), earlier releases of the software, all 
accompanying written materials, and prior written agreements whether contained 
in manuals, sealed media package(s) or otherwise (hereafter referred to as 
"Products").

3.	NO LICENSE TO DEVELOP APPLICATION PROGRAM.  McObject grants you a limited,
non-exclusive, nonassignable, nontransferable right to evaluate the 
Products enclosed in the software media package(s) in source code form (if 
supplied or in your possession) and object code form for a period of 60 days 
beginning from the Effective Date of this Agreement.

4.	LICENSE TO MODIFY SOURCE.  You may modify and compile the Product 
source code, if supplied for evaluation by McObject, provided you do not delete 
copyright notices.  All modified versions are part of the licensed Products, 
subject to this Agreement and the property of McObject.  You must deliver to 
McObject on written request copies of all modifications of, partial replacements 
of, and extensions to McObject source code.  McObject does not support modified 
source code.  You may not compile the source code for use with an operating 
system other than the target operating system for the source code package you 
received from McObject.

5.	NO LICENSE TO DISTRIBUTE.  You may not distribute an Application Program 
that includes the McObject Product.  Distribute means the reproduction for 
installation, whether for commercial resale, not-for-profit, internal use, or 
any other use other than to evaluate the McObject software.

6.	OTHER RESTRICTIONS.  These licenses are personal to you, the Development 
Entity.  The Development Entity may be an individual or organization.  It may be 
a division or subsidiary of a larger organization or the affiliate of a smaller 
organization.  In any event, McObject grants this license only to the 
Development Entity.  You may not use, distribute, or transfer the Products 
except as allowed by this license.  You may not sell, assign, sublicense, lease, 
or otherwise transfer any part of this license.  A sale of a majority of your 
Development Entity is deemed a transfer.  You may not retain copies, even of 
prior versions of the Products, on termination of this license.  Your 
obligations under this Agreement survive any substitution or termination of the 
licenses granted by this Agreement.

7.	OWNERSHIP AND COPYRIGHT.  McObject LLC or its suppliers own the 
Product(s).  National copyright laws and international treaty provisions 
protect them.  The Products contain proprietary information.  You must protect 
the Products like any other copyrighted material and keep the source code in 
strict confidence, ensuring that anyone with access to the Products refrains 
from unauthorized reproduction, use or disclosure.  

8.	TERMS AND TERMINATION.  You may terminate this license by returning or 
destroying all copies of the Product in your control and notifying McObject in 
writing.  This license, including your right to evaluate the Products, will 
terminate automatically if you infringe McObject copyrights or breach this 
Agreement.  McObject may suspend or terminate this license if you fail to pay 
any amount due McObject or any McObject subsidiary.  McObject may suspend or 
terminate this license, with 30 days prior notice and opportunity to cure, if 
you fail to pay any amount due any McObject distributor or dealer.  

9. 	LIMITED WARRANTY.  McObject disclaims all warranties, either expressed or 
implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and 
fitness for a particular purpose, and all other remedies for breach of the above 
warranty.  You assume all risks with respect to accuracy, adequacy, quality, 
reliability, and performance of the Products.  All implied warranties which may 
not be disclaimed are limited to 30 days.  Some jurisdictions do not allow 
limitations on duration of implied warranties, so the above limitation may not 
apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You may 
have other rights, different from the warranty given by McObject.

10. 	NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  In no event will McObject, 
its resellers, or suppliers be liable for consequential damages (including, 
without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business 
interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising 
out of the use of or inability to use the Products, whether in an action based 
on contract or tort, including negligence or strict liability, even if you 
advise McObject of the possibility of such damages.  McObject's total 
liability under this Agreement is limited in the aggregate to amounts you paid 
for this Product and license.

11. 	TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  Technical support by email and telephone is available 
on a first-come, first-served basis during the evaluation period.

12. 	U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  The Products under this Agreement are 
commercial computer software programs and documentation developed exclusively at 
private expense.  If Products are acquired by or on behalf of the Department of 
Defense, use, disclosure, modification, distribution, and reproduction are subject 
to the standard limitations and restrictions set forth in the body of this 
Agreement, and as permitted by DFAR 227.7202-1.  If Products are acquired by other 
U.S. Government agencies or on their behalf, the Products are furnished with 
Limited and Restricted Rights as otherwise set forth herein, or as set forth in 
FAR 52.227-19(b)(1)and(2) as may be required.

13. 	SEVERABILITY.  Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement 
must be interpreted so as to be valid under applicable law.  If any provision 
is invalid, the remaining provisions remain enforceable. 

14. 	DISPUTES.  The laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without regard 
to its conflicts of law rules, control this Agreement, and the United Nations 
Convention on the International Sale of Goods does not apply.  It is 
enforceable by McObject or its distributors and dealers.  Disputes will be 
finally resolved in arbitration, before one arbitrator, under American 
Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules and conducted in Seattle, 
Washington, U.S.A., or under the UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration in Stockholm, 
Sweden, at McObject's option.  If conducted in Sweden, the arbitration will be 
conducted in English, and administered by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.  
The prevailing party in any action related to an alleged infringement of 
McObject proprietary rights is entitled to recover its costs and expenses, 
including reasonable attorneys' fees.  You consent to personal jurisdiction in 
the federal and state courts in the State of Washington, U.S.A.  A prevailing 
party may enter judgment on an arbitral award in any court having jurisdiction.
These provisions will survive the termination of this Agreement, regardless of 
the cause of termination.
